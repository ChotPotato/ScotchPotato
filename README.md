A Hot Potato Trivia Game made by the Scots! Or the Scotland Phoenix JavaScript Team.

## Structure
There are 2 top level folders to the project
- public for the client, which is a yeoman scaffolded Flux/React project.
- api for the api/backend, which is sailsjs.

## Client Connection to Api/backend!
With the help of [sails websockets SDK](https://github.com/balderdashy/sails.io.js) we have a connection to the backend for data services. Would be nice to have a fallback to REST!!
